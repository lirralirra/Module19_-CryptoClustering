# Module19_-CryptoClustering

This module focuses on using scikit-learn in Python to perform unsupervised learning for clustering cryptocurrencies.

### Objectives:

Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters:
Use the elbow method to decide the best number of groups for clustering.


Compare Clustering Results:
Perform clustering using K-means with all features.
Reduce dimensions using PCA and compare clustering results with PCA-transformed data.
